*   **Words to Avoid:** Magic, generic, out-of-the-box, autopilot, basic.
    

3\. UI/UX Design System: The "Linear-Greptile" Overhaul
-------------------------------------------------------

This system moves Emdex Labs from a "Corporate Service" look to a **Premium Engineering Product.**

### A. The Color System (High Contrast & Atmospheric)

*   **Surface Primary:** Deep Matte Black (#0A0A0B).
    
*   **Surface Secondary (Cards/Modals):** Dark Slate (#161618).
    
*   **The "Intelligence" Accent:** Emdex Cyan/Electric Teal (#00F5FF) for "active" states and glows.
    
*   **Success/Action:** Lime Green (#ADFF2F) for "Live" systems.
    
*   **Borders:** Subtle Gradient (#FFFFFF1A at top-left to #FFFFFF00 at bottom-right).
    

### B. Typography & Hierarchy

*   **Headings:** _Inter_ or _Geist Sans_ (Weight: 600, Letter Spacing: -0.02em).
    
*   **Body:** _Inter_ (Weight: 400).
    
*   **Data & Labels:** _JetBrains Mono_ or _IBM Plex Mono_ (Weight: 400).
    
    *   _Detail:_ Labels should be All-Caps, 11px, with 0.05em letter spacing.
        
*   **Contrast Rule:** Use **60/30/10** contrast. 60% Zinc-400 (secondary text), 30% White (headings), 10% Cyan (highlights).
    

### C. Layout & Grid (The Bento System)

*   **Structure:** Use a strict **Bento Box** grid for sector showcases (Healthcare, Agriculture, etc.).
    
*   **Gaps:** Base-8 system (exactly 16px between items).
    
*   **Radii:** Sharp, modern corners—8px for cards, 4px for buttons. Use **Squircles** for a premium hardware feel.
    
*   **Atmospheric Depth:** No drop shadows. Use 1px gradient borders and high-blur (60px) radial glows with 0.15 opacity.
    

4\. Competitive Inspirations & Specific Details
-----------------------------------------------

*   **Linear Style:** Use **Surface-on-Surface borders** (slightly lighter grey border than the background) to separate layers rather than shadows.
    
*   **Vercel Depth:** For featured cards, use a faint, rotating **Conic Gradient** background to simulate light reflecting off high-end metal.
    
*   **Stripe Density:** Implement **Mega-Menus with Micro-Icons** (e.g., a tiny Amber icon for Energy) with 2-line descriptions.
    
*   **Raycast Precision:** Every bento box should have a **"Label"** in the top left corner in Mono font (e.g., // SECTOR: 01).
    

5\. Interaction & Motion Specifications
---------------------------------------

*   **The "Magnetic" Button:** Buttons have a slight pull towards the cursor when within 20px.
    
*   **Active State:** Use a **"Scale-In"** effect. scale(0.98) on click, returning to 1.0 with a spring transition (stiffness: 300, damping: 20).
    
*   **Cursor Tracking:** A low-opacity radial gradient follows the mouse movement behind the Bento grid.
    
*   **Data Visualization:** Use **"Step" lines** for graphs (not smooth curves) to reinforce the "Engineering Lab" aesthetic.
    
*   **Glassmorphism:** Navigation bars use backdrop-filter: blur(8px) with a low-opacity charcoal fill.
    

6\. Sector-Specific Messaging Pillars
-------------------------------------

**Holistic Intelligence:** Focus on the synergy between AI models and physical IoT/Robotics.

**Engineering Excellence:** Emphasize DevOps, Architecture, and high-quality, scalable code.

**Security-First:** Highlight SOC 2 compliance and proactive threat detection.

**Physical Outcomes:** Use specific projects (Lucknow Eco-Pond, Vehicle Recognition) as "Engineering Proofs."

7\. Imagery & Iconography (Visual Assets)
-----------------------------------------

### A. Imagery Strategy
*   **No Stock People:** Absolutely NO generic photos of people shaking hands, meetings, or suits.
*   **Abstract 3D:** Use **High-Fidelity Abstract 3D Assets**. Think "Glass-and-Metal" renders, robots, IoT nodes, floating data structures.
*   **Technical Diagrams:** Use schematic overlays and technical wireframes to represent concepts.

### B. Iconography
*   **Style:** **Thin-line icons** (2pt stroke).
*   **Libraries:** Use **Phosphor** or **Lucide** icons.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain uniform stroke width and corner style throughout.

### C. Code Visuals
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** When showing code or logic, use **High-Contrast Syntax Highlighting**.
*   **Content:** Show snippets of AI models, IoT logic, or config files (YAML/JSON) directly in the UI.
*   **Font:** Always use _JetBrains Mono_ for code.
